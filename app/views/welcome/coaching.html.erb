      <h3>Why you should consider coaching: </h3>
      <p>
        &emsp;  Hiring a professional will help you cut down the time and effort you spend on achieving your physique and weight goals by a tremendous amount. Besides losing some weight in a healthy and sustainable way (not crash dieting and gaining it all back a week after), you'll <strong>learn</strong> how to do manage your weight for life; <strong>This is an absolutely invaluable skill.</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Also, having the accountability and guidance will get you the lifestyle habits you'll need to do this long term. <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>
        <h3>What do I offer?</h3>

        There's a couple different levels of coaching:

        Custom meal plan and all the guidance you need to make sure you succeed. I teach you how to mealprep easily and quickly, and guarantee results. <br><br>

        Flexible dieting Coaching where I teach you everything you need to know about macros to succeed. <br><br>

        Simple Nutrition Coaching for people who want to have a more relaxed approach without measuring everything they eat, but still see results. I'll teach you the basics of proper nutrition, how to make adjustments, find flaws in your current diet and how to replace them for better options, etc.



        <br>
        I like to teach all my clients the fundamentals of proper nutrition so that they don't need me after our coaching time is over. <br>
        <br>
        If you're interested, consultations are free and there's no obligations.
      </p>

      <h3>What results can you expect?</h3>

      &emsp; Most of the people I work with want to lose weight, and in my experience there too many variables for me to pinpoint exactly how much weight you'll lose in 12 weeks; I can tell you I've had people lose up to 15 pounds in a healthy way without starving themselves.

      That being said, the average for an adult male who does weight training is about 10 pounds; and for females it's about 8 pounds.

      For those trying to gain weight and get stronger, this is a slower process; you can only feasibly gain about half a pound of quality weight a week, and anything over that will come with accompanying fat.
